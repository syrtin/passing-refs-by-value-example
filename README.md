# "Passing references by value in Java" example

#### My illustration example on "Reference data type parameters, such as objects, are also passed into methods by value".

This example represents the mechanism of Passing Reference Data Type Arguments described in the Java documentation,
which says, that "when the method returns, the passed-in reference still references the same object as before".

PS: Also we should notice that:
"the values of the object's fields can be changed in the method, if they have the proper access level"!

However, that doesn't change the fact that both primitive and reference types are passed in methods by value.
